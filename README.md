# ML-Regression-Project
The power plant of Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011) was set to work with full load. 
The various features in the dataset consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Exhaust Vacuum (V), Ambient Pressure (AP) and Relative Humidity (RH) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant.
